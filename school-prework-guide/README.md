# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a new programmer, this will be my first project of hopefully many. Iâ€™m trying my hand at programming, hoping to learn a new and desirable skill set. 

This program, Prework Study Guide webpage will assist me in keeping notes and encourage me to explore more functions of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub. 

Over the course of this project, I learned the basic building blocks of a web application. The HTML frame, the CSS skin of it, the logic of JavaScript, and its functions, and how to store, recall, Push and pull, and learn how my peers can look over my work with GitHub. I still got a long way to go.I still got a long way to go on my coding journey, but we all have to start somewhere.
